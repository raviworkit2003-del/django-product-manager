# Django Product Manager
  A beginner-friendly Django project that demonstrates core backend concepts including models, views, URLs, templates, and the Django ORM.
  This project was built to understand the full Django request–response flow, not just copy code.
  
## Features

- Product management using Django ORM

- Django Admin integration

- List products using views + templates

- Proper URL routing (project & app level)

- SQLite database (development)

- Clean app-based structure


## What This Project Covers

- Django project vs app structure

- Models (models.py)

- Views (views.py)

- URL routing (urls.py)

- Templates (templates/)

- Django ORM (objects.all())

- Admin panel usage
